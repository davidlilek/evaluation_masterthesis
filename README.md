# Data analysis and evaluation master thesis

This repo contains all data evaluation steps which were performed in the course of the master thesis "Development and validation of a workflow for the evaluation of bottom-up
proteomics data using MaxQuant and R" in 2022. The master thesis was submitted by David Lilek at the Austrian Biotech University of Applied Sciences.

Most of the customized scripts were created using R for post-processing of the MaxQuant results. The post-processing included filterung, statistical analysis and vizualization.
R version R version 4.2.0 was used ([session_info_R.txt](https://github.com/davidlilek/evaluation_masterthesis/files/9149696/session_info_R.txt)).

For performance test in MaxQuant different parameters were varied, as shown below. Derived from this result in the script names. For example:

* MBR_pooled_oldversion: MBR was used; pooling was done in MaxQuant; old version of MaxQuant was used
* MBR: MBR was used; pooling was done manually
* noMBR_pooled_secondpeptides: MBR was disabled; pooling was done in MaxQuant; option second peptides was enabled
* ...
